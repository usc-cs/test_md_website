## USC CS Markdown Webpage Template

Welcome! 

This is a website built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which compiles Markdown-written documents into webpages, like what you're seeing right now. It's designed to be robus and flexible, allowing the teaching staff to easily create and maintain a website with minimal setup.

In addition to [standard Markdown syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/), Syntax Highlighting and MathJax is also supported!

```cpp
using namespace std;
int main() {
	std::cout << "Hello there" << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

```java
public class Whoa {
	public static int main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("This is awesomeeeee");
		return 0;
	}
}
```

Inline \\( sin(x^2) \\), or standalone MathJax:

$$ sin(x^2) $$
